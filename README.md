# Simple ATM Simulation

## Project Overview
The Simple ATM Simulation is a Java console-based project designed to perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking account balance.  
It demonstrates the use of core Java concepts like classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, and control statements.

## Objectives
- To understand and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.  
- To develop a simple banking system that allows user interaction through the console.  
- To practice Java fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## Features
1. PIN Authentication — Verifies the user's PIN before allowing access.  
2. Deposit Money — Allows the user to add funds to their balance.  
3. Withdraw Money — Enables withdrawal with insufficient balance check.  
4. Check Balance — Displays the current account balance.  
5. Exit Option — Safely exits the program.
